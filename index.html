        <h2>How to play:</h2>
        <p>You will have 4 crystals.  Each crystal will be given a random value.</p>
        <p>You will be given a target total score chosen by random.</p>
        <p>When you click on a crystal, the value of that crystal will be added to your goal score.</p> 
        <p>Your task is to make your total score match the goal total. if you match it, you win!  If you go over, you lose.</p>
        <p>If you need to, you can adjust your score by deleting crystals.  You can also click the restart button to start from scratch.  You can also quit and start again with new values, but it will be counted as a loss.</p>
        <p>Each new game will have a different target total score and gems with differnt values.</p>
        <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
